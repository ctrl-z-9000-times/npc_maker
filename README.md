# The NPC Maker

The NPC Maker is a framework for interacting with simulated environments which
contain AI agents. It provides a set of interfaces which separate the
environment from its surrounding concerns, and APIs for using the interfaces.
This repository also contains a collection of ready-to-use tools and environments.

The framework consists of four major components:
* [The Environments](/docs/environments.md)
* [The AI Agents](/docs/controllers.md)
* [The Evolutionary Algorithms](/docs/evolution.md)
* [The Management Programs](/docs/management.md)

This repository hosts a list of publicly available programs which interface
with the NPC Maker framework.

* [**Controllers**](controllers.md)  

If you would like to see your environment or control system here then please
