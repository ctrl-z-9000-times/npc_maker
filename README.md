# The NPC Maker

The NPC Maker is a framework for interacting with simulated environments that
contain AI agents. It defines software interfaces that separate environments
from their surrounding concerns, and provides APIs for using them.
The framework also provides a collection of ready-to-use tools and environments.

The framework consists of three major components:
* [Simulated Environments](/docs/environments.md)
* [Control Systems](/docs/controllers.md)
* [Evolutionary Algorithms](/docs/evolution.md)
