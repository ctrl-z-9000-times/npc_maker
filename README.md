# The NPC Maker

The NPC Maker is a framework for interacting with simulated environments which
contain AI agents. It provides a set of interfaces which separate the
environment from its surrounding concerns, and APIs for using the interfaces.
This repository also contains a collection of ready-to-use tools and environments.

The framework consists of three major components:
* [The Environments](/docs/environments.md)
* [The AI Agents](/docs/controllers.md)
* [The Evolutionary Algorithms](/docs/evolution.md)
