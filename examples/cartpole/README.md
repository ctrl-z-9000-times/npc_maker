# Example Environment: Cartpole

The goal of cart-pole challenge is to balance an inverted pendulum.
This is a classic problem in control theory and has been studied extensively.
An inverted pendulum is a thin rigid rod balanced vertically on its end.
It is unstable. It will fall over because its center of mass is far above its
point of contact with the ground. The rod is placed on a moving platform, and
by moving the platform underneath the rod we can keep the rod balanced.
This challenge is akin to balancing an object on your fingertip. For simplicity
the platform is on horizontal rails and the entire system is constrained to two
dimensions.

The double-pole challenge is a cart with two poles balanced on it.
The poles fall over at different speeds because they have different lengths,
which makes this scenario more difficult than the single pole version.
